            <h3>About the Project</h3>
            <p>As college students, we constantly juggled academics, extracurriculars, and personal commitments, often struggling to stay organized and accountable for our time. While various planning tools exist, none fully met our needs in a single, cohesive application. Through human-centered design research, we set out to understand how students currently manage their schedules and where existing solutions fall short. Our research explored how students plan their daily routines, what features they like and dislike in current tools, how consistently they follow their plans, and the obstacles that prevent them from staying on track. We employed task observation, contextual inquiry, and interviews, analyzing both qualitative and quantitative data to reveal patterns that guided feature development. Our goal was to create an app that not only simplifies time management but also fosters accountability and adaptability in a way that aligns with students’ real-life behaviors. After building an initial prototype, we conducted moderated usability tests to gather feedback and make improvements, followed by unmoderated user testing via Qualtrics, with results analyzed in SPSS.</p>

            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <h4 class="subheading">Problem</h4>
            <p>College students and other young adults with flexible but busy schedules struggle to stay held accountable to their schedules.The current planning/schedule-building tools such as Google Calendar, Outlook, IOS Reminders, etc., contain beneficial features, but lack a cohesive system that simplifies the experience, as well as engaging features to encourage continued use.
            <br>
            <h4 class="subheading">Solution</h4>
            <p>My team and I identified a way to use social influence to the user's advantage. Using inspiration from the existing application, BeReal, we designed a prototype guided by user research for an app with a similar concept, but with a productive twist. Once a day, users are notified to post a picture of their current activity. If they choose to share it with their feed, the user's friends will see the picture as well as any previously scheduled activities. </p>
                <br>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <h4 class="subheading">Contextual Inquiry</h4>
            <p>After deciding on this topic, we initated contextual inquiry studies. In these research sessions, participants between the ages of 18-22 were interviewed while walking through the process of scheduling their day. As a group of 4, we each interviewed a participant in a different year of college (first-year, sophmore, etc.) from various majors. My participant was a 21 year-old junior studying civil engineering.
                <br>
                <br>
                An initial challenge was deciding how to study how effective the participants were at sticking with their plans. To address this, we conducted the interviews in two parts. The first interview took place in the morning, where the participants where asked to show their schedule for the day they had created in their scheduling software of choice (ex. Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar, etc.). The second interview took place at the end of the day, and participants were asked to reflect on their day and their success at accomplishing their goals.

            <h4 class="subheading">Task Analysis</h4> 
            <p>Using data collected from our contextual inquiries, we performed qualititative data analysis by coding the transcripts of our interviews with recurring themes.This allowed us to narrow down the primary pain points users experienced with existing technology.</p>
            
            <div class="pain-points">
                <h4>⚠️Pain Points</h4>
                <ul>
                <li>Difficulty balancing work and personal responsibilities in a users' schedule</li>
                <li>Forgetfulness, especially of small details </li>
                <li>Lack of effective accountability for sticking to schedule</li>
                <li>Trouble adapting to unexpected circumstances</li>
            </ul>
        </div> 
        <br>
        <p>Another product of the qualitative analysis was a hierarchial task analysis. We started by identifying the main steps taken by users when planning a daily schedule, and narrowed them down into tasks: 1.0 Creating, 2.0 Following, and 3.0 Evaluating a schedule. From there, the substeps taken within each of these were summarized to fully understand the user's current workflow.</p>

        <h3>Design Process</h3>

            <h4 class="subheading">Lo-fi Sketches</h4>

                <p>The first pain point we discovered from our contextual inquiry was the difficulty of maintaining a balance of work-related and personal activities. 
                Our users expressed that a critical aspect of accomplishing their goals was prioritizing their health and wellness through healthy behaviors 
                such as eating well-rounded meals, spending time with friends, and getting enough sleep. The task wheel pictured in the image on the left was created 
                to address this by visually showing the time spent on each category for a given week. Each rung on the wheel indicates the proportion of time dedicated to 
                that category,which is calculated based on their scheduled activities for the week. </p>
            <br>
            <div class="column" style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
                <div><img src="bebusy/bebusy lofi -2.png" height="500px" width="500px"></div>  
              
                <div><img src="bebusy/bebusy lofi-1.png" height="500px" width="550px"></div>  

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Social influence was another recoccuring topic throughout our initial interviews. Many participants mentioned peers having a strong affect on their productivity, sometimes positive and sometimes negative. Peers seem to be a source of accountability, but can sometimes be source of distraction if productivity and socializing overlap too much. </p>

<br>
<br>
        <h4 class="subheading">Style/Components</h4>
            <p>Creating a style guide was where we really go to let our creative sides shine. I think my team and I really bonded over our attention to detail and eye for design, which made this pretty fun. We utilized a combination of bright colors to create a fun, engaging atmosphere, paired with simple but clean font choices. </p>
            <img src="bebusy/Style Guide BeBusy.svg" height="500px">
            <br>
            <p>The primary connecting component was the nav bar, which was present on all screens. Other important components such as the logo, time management wheel, and buttons can also be found on the style guide.</p>
            <br>

        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
            <h4 class="subheading">Moderated Usability Tests</h4>
            <p>Moderated Usability Tests were performed in person or virtually. The participant of each test was given one task at a time to complete. As researchers, our job was to observe the participant performing the given tasks and record their workflow. By recording data such as the time it took to complete tasks or navigate to new screens, as well as any feedback provided by the user, we were later able to analyze ways to improve the prototype. The following tasks were tested during our inital usability testing:</P>
            <ol>
                <li>Check time spent on each category in weekly breakdown</li>
                <li>Use camera feature to take picture of current task</li>
                <li>View feed and comment</li>
                <li>Use calendar to schedule event</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The findings from these walkthroughs revealed that our design was headed in the right direction, but needed some key modifications. For instance, the calendar function was well received, but some users mentioned that they'd like to view their schedule in a weekly and monthly format, in addition to the daily view. Others expressed difficulty when using the "BeBusy" feature to take a photo of their current task. </p>
        
            <img src="bebusy/Calendar Modifications.svg">
            <br>
            <img src="bebusy/Camera Modifications.svg">
            <br>
            <p>The following modifications were added to address these concerns in the second version of our prototype. Additional frames added the functionality of viewing a user's schedule in a weekly and monthly view. This can be accessed through a simple sub menu feature.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To simplfy the process of taking a picture to post to a user's feed, a button was added directly below the post button to retake a picture. Originally this functionality was carried out by clicking the green reverse arrow in the upper left corner. The reverse button now allows the user to switch between the pictures taken from the front and back cameras.</p>
