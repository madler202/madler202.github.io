            <h3>About the Project</h3>
            <p>As college students, we constantly juggled academics, extracurriculars, and personal commitments, often struggling to stay organized and accountable for our time. While various planning tools exist, none fully met our needs in a single, cohesive application. Through human-centered design research, we set out to understand how students currently manage their schedules and where existing solutions fall short. Our research explored how students plan their daily routines, what features they like and dislike in current tools, how consistently they follow their plans, and the obstacles that prevent them from staying on track. We employed task observation, contextual inquiry, and interviews, analyzing both qualitative and quantitative data to reveal patterns that guided feature development. Our goal was to create an app that not only simplifies time management but also fosters accountability and adaptability in a way that aligns with students’ real-life behaviors. After building an initial prototype, we conducted moderated usability tests to gather feedback and make improvements, followed by unmoderated user testing via Qualtrics, with results analyzed in SPSS.</p>

            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <h4 class="subheading">Problem</h4>
            <p>College students and other young adults with flexible but busy schedules struggle to stay held accountable to their schedules.The current planning/schedule-building tools such as Google Calendar, Outlook, IOS Reminders, etc., contain beneficial features, but lack a cohesive system that simplifies the experience, as well as engaging features to encourage continued use.
            <br>
            <h4 class="subheading">Solution</h4>
            <p>My team and I identified a way to use social influence to the user's advantage. Using inspiration from the existing application, BeReal, we designed a prototype guided by user research for an app with a similar concept, but with a productive twist. Once a day, users are notified to post a picture of their current activity. If they choose to share it with their feed, the user's friends will see the picture as well as any previously scheduled activities. </p>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <h4 class="subheading">Contextual Inquiry</h4>
            <p>After deciding on this topic, we initated contextual inquiry studies. In these research sessions, participants between the ages of 18-22 were interviewed while walking through the process of scheduling their day. As a group of 4, we each interviewed a participant in a different year of college (first-year, sophmore, etc.) from various majors. My participant was a 21 year-old junior studying civil engineering.
                <br>
                <br>
                An initial challenge was deciding how to study how effective the participants were at sticking with their plans. To address this, we conducted the interviews in two parts. The first interview took place in the morning, where the participants where asked to show their schedule for the day they had created in their scheduling software of choice (ex. Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar, etc.). The second interview took place at the end of the day, and participants were asked to reflect on their day and their success at accomplishing their goals.

            <h4 class="subheading">Task Analysis</h4> 
            <p>Using data collected from our contextual inquiries, we performed qualititative data analysis by coding the transcripts of our interviews with recurring themes.This allowed us to narrow down the primary pain points users experienced with existing technology.</p>
            
            <div class="pain-points">
                <h4>⚠️Pain Points</h4>
                <ul>
                <li>Difficulty balancing work and personal responsibilities in a users' schedule</li>
                <li>Forgetfulness, especially of small details </li>
                <li>Lack of effective accountability for sticking to schedule</li>
                <li>Trouble adapting to unexpected circumstances</li>
            </ul>
        </div> 
        <br>
        <p>Another product of the qualitative analysis was a hierarchial task analysis. We started by identifying the main steps taken by users when planning a daily schedule, and narrowed them down into tasks: 1.0 Creating, 2.0 Following, and 3.0 Evaluating a schedule. From there, the substeps taken within each of these were summarized to fully understand the user's current workflow.</p>

        <h3>Design Process</h3>

            <h4 class="subheading">Lo-fi Sketches</h4>
<p>The first pain point we discovered from our contextual inquiry was the difficulty of maintaining a balance of work-related and personal activities. Our users expressed that a critical aspect of accomplishing their goals was prioritizing their health and wellness through healthy behaviors such as eating well-rounded meals, spending time with friends, and getting enough sleep. The task wheel pictured in the image on the right was created to address this by visually showing the time spent on each category for a given week. Each rung on the wheel indicates the proportion of time dedicated to that category, which is calculated based on their scheduled activities for the week.
