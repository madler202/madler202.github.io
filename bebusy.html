            <h3>About the Project</h3>
            <p>As college students, we constantly juggled academics, extracurriculars, and personal commitments, often struggling to stay organized and accountable for our time. While various planning tools exist, none fully met our needs in a single, cohesive application. Through human-centered design research, we set out to understand how students currently manage their schedules and where existing solutions fall short. Our research explored how students plan their daily routines, what features they like and dislike in current tools, how consistently they follow their plans, and the obstacles that prevent them from staying on track. We employed task observation, contextual inquiry, and interviews, analyzing both qualitative and quantitative data to reveal patterns that guided feature development. Our goal was to create an app that not only simplifies time management but also fosters accountability and adaptability in a way that aligns with students’ real-life behaviors. After building an initial prototype, we conducted moderated usability tests to gather feedback and make improvements, followed by unmoderated user testing via Qualtrics, with results analyzed in SPSS.</p>

            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <h4 class="subheading">Problem</h4>
            <p>College students and other young adults with flexible but busy schedules struggle to stay held accountable to their schedules.
            <br>
            <br>
                The current planning/schedule-building tools such as Google Calendar, Outlook, IOS Reminders, etc., contain beneficial features, but lack a cohesive system that simplifies the experience, as well as engaging features to encourage continued use.
            <br>
            <h4 class="subheading">Solution</h4>
            <p>My team and I identified a way to use social influence to the user's advantage. Using inspiration from the existing application, BeReal, we designed a prototype guided by user research for an app with a similar concept, but with a productive twist.
                <br>
                <br>
                Once a day, users are notified to post a picture of their current activity. If they choose to share it with their feed, the user's friends will see the picture as well as any previously scheduled activities. </p>
                <br>
                <div class="prototype">
                    <h4>Final Prototype</h4>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <h4 class="subheading">Contextual Inquiry</h4>
            <p>After deciding on this topic, we initated contextual inquiry studies. In these research sessions, participants between the ages of 18-22 were interviewed while walking through the process of scheduling their day. As a group of 4, we each interviewed a participant in a different year of college (first-year, sophmore, etc.) from various majors. My participant was a 21 year-old junior studying civil engineering.
                <br>
                <br>
                An initial challenge was deciding how to study how effective the participants were at sticking with their plans. To address this, we conducted the interviews in two parts. The first interview took place in the morning, where the participants where asked to show their schedule for the day they had created in their scheduling software of choice (ex. Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar, etc.). The second interview took place at the end of the day, and participants were asked to reflect on their day and their success at accomplishing their goals.

            <p>Members of the ACERT team expressed the desire to represent their business units visually. Specific ideas the team wanted to convey included the two distinct sectors of AstraZeneca, BBU/OBU pharmaceutical products and RDU pharmaceutical products, while also highlighting the unity between them. We also experimented with ways to make the business units differ from each other such as through shape and color. The use of round, molecule-like shapes was inspired by one of AstraZeneca's key values: Follow the science. </p>

            <h3>Usability Testing</h3>

            <h3>Reflections</h3>  

            <p>This project was a valuable learning experience that deepened my understanding of IT’s role in the pharmaceutical industry and strengthened my ability to develop user-centric solutions in a corporate setting. One of my key takeaways was the importance of balancing technical feasibility with user needs—whether it was simplifying navigation, optimizing document storage, or ensuring long-term maintainability for future stakeholders. Additionally, working within governance and compliance frameworks reinforced my appreciation for structured operating procedures and the significance of designing solutions that align with industry regulations.<br></p>  
            <br>
            <p>Looking back, one thing I would do differently is incorporate more iterative user testing earlier in the process. While stakeholder feedback was integral to my design decisions, more frequent usability testing with end-users could have provided additional insights into pain points and potential improvements.<br></p>   
            <br>   
            <p>Moving forward, I plan to apply these lessons by continuing to prioritize user research, regulatory considerations, and scalable design in my future projects. This experience has reinforced my interest in designing and implementing technology solutions that bridge the gap between business needs and user experience, and I am excited to bring this mindset into my next professional endeavors.</p>
